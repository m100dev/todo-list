# TodoList
This is a light task managing application that allows you to add tasks to a list, remove tasks from the list, and display the list in the console.

* There will be new features that will:
    1. Add a text input field to the app instead of prompts.
    2. Display the list items dynamically using DOM manipulation.
    3. Style the page to make it pretty.
    4. Implement client-side form validation for secure JS practices.
